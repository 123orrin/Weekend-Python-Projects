# Skills Analyzer
The purpose of the skills analyzer is to analyze a multitude of skills collected from different job description to determine which skills are the most valuable for that speicific job. Currently, the script includes a jobs and research opportunities I am interested in pursuing and wanted to learn more about.

Currently, the script only analyzes skills and the skills detection and categorization has to be performed manually. In the future, I hope to write a webscraper that will be able to automatically collect this data.
