# Sudoku Solver
Sudoku solver is a project which implements the traditional game of [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku), as well as a variety of [Sudoku Solvers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_solving_algorithms). You can play the game yourself in the terminal, or watch the algorithm solve it for you.

Each time it is run, the program chooses 1 of 1 million sudokus using an opensource sudoku set on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bryanpark/sudoku) (Created by Kyubyong Park). Currently, the only solver implemented is the backtracking solver. In the future, I hope to implement other types of solvers as well as a graphical user interface where the user can both play and visualize automatic solvers.
