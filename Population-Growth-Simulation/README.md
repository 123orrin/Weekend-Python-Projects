# Population Growth Simulation
The program simulates population growth using a set of initial conditions. The idea was originally proposed by Sitif on [Medium](https://siti2718f.medium.com/building-simulations-in-python-a-step-by-step-walkthrough-a3972729027c).

My implementation allows for the calculation of basic population statistics. It also provides automatic exportation of data in an Excel sheet, which can then be used for further analysis.
