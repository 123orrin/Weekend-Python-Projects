# Traffic Light FSM
An FSM stands for Finite State Machine. It is a mathematical model that uses sequential logic to decide on actions that the system should perform. This is my implementation of a Intersection Traffic Light. 

Currently, the program is terminal based and runs on a predetermined simulation. In the future, I aim to implement a graphic interface and increase the complexity by adding pedestrians, accidents, etc.
