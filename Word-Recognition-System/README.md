# Word Recognition System
This system uses the method of cosine-similarity to determine relationships between words. It was trained using historical literature from the Gutenburg Project and tested TOEFL Exams.

The literature I used to test the books were:
  - [War and Peace](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2600), by Graf Leo Tolstoy
  - [Swann's Way](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7178), by Marcel Proust

These works are provided in the repository, along with a sample test file.
