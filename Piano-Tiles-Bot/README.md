# Piano Tiles Bot
This a a gaming bot designed to play the hit game, Piano Tiles. It can play the game in two ways: using the mouse or using the keyboard. Currently, it must be manually calibrated to find the clickable area and the colour of the pixel to click. In the future, I hope to automate both these tasks.
