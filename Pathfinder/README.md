# Pathfinder
This is a pathfinder program that finds the shortest path between two points using the [A* Search Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm). It was written by following a tutorial created by TechWithTim, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtiK0DOeI4A).

Features of this program include implementation of the A* Algorithm, a graphic user interface, and utilization of the pygame module.
